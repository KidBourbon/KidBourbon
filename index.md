# Welcome to my blog!

## 1. Who am I?
### - Studies
I am currently a 3rd year computer engineering student at the Technological University of Havana (CUJAE). I am finishing up a Junior Programmer course in Unity, posted on the website: [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/). I also studied some tutorials on the website: [skills.github.com](https://skills.github.com/)


### - Skills
During my degree I have gained experience programming with:
C, Java, Python, Postgresql, R, Mathlab.

Since December 2020 I have been learning everything related to Unity, especially programming with C#, for game development. I also have experience with GitHub and version control.

I can speak four languages:
- Spanish (native)
- English (Advanced)
- Russian (Intermediate)


### - Job experience
At the moment, I have no work experience. I'm looking for a job as Unity Junior Programmer or Unity Junior Developer.


### - Future plans
At the moment I will finish the university and the junior programmer course at Unity. Later I will take other Unity courses from the same website (learn.unity.com), to continue expanding my knowledge, mainly in the field of programming. After college, I will start looking for a job in the game development industry.
