## Job experience
At the moment, I have no work experience. I'm looking for a job as Unity Junior Programmer or Unity Junior Developer.

## Future plans
At the moment I will finish the university, the CS50x course and the Junior Programmer course at Unity. Later I will take other Unity courses from the same website (learn.unity.com), to continue expanding my knowledge, mainly in the field of programming and videogame development. After college, I will start looking for a job in the game development industry.

## Personal projects
I have three personal projects made with Unity:
- Ball run (platform 3D videogame)
- [Knight, monsters and arena](https://github.com/KidBourbon/knight-monsters-arena) (action 3D videogame)
- [Bea's Gift](https://github.com/KidBourbon/bea-gift) (endless runner mobile Game)
