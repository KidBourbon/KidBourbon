# Welcome to my profile!

## 1. Who am I?
### - Studies
I am currently a 4th year computer engineering student at the Technological University of Havana (CUJAE). I am finishing the online course "CS50x - Computer Science" taught by professors from Harvard University. After this course I will start another course "CS50G - Video Game Development" to learn more about game development with Love2D and Unity. I am also finishing up a Junior Programmer course in Unity, posted on the website: [learn.unity.com](https://learn.unity.com/). I also studied some tutorials on the website: [skills.github.com](https://skills.github.com/)

<br>

### - Skills
Since December 2020 I have been learning everything related to Unity, especially programming with C#, for game development. I also have experience with GitHub and version control.

<br>

During my degree I have gained experience programming with:
<br>
C, Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL - Postgresql, R

<br>

I can speak three languages:
- Spanish (native)
- English (Advanced)
- Russian (Intermediate)

<br>

### - Job experience
At the moment, I have no work experience. I'm looking for a job as Unity Junior Programmer or Unity Junior Developer.

<br>

### - Future plans
At the moment I will finish the university, the CS50x course and the Junior Programmer course at Unity. Later I will take other Unity courses from the same website (learn.unity.com), to continue expanding my knowledge, mainly in the field of programming and videogame development. After college, I will start looking for a job in the game development industry.
