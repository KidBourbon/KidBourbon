# Welcome to my profile!

## Studies
- I am a 4th year university student of Computer Engineering with an academic index of 4.94/5.
- I finished the online course "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science" from HarvardX.
- I finished the online course "Unity Essentials Pathway" from Unity Technologies.

## Experiencie and skills
More than two years of experience using Unity 3D game engine and programming with C#. Currently, I'm developing with a team a virtual hydraulics laboratory using Unity 3D. I'm programming the UI and the internal mechanics of the laboratory. I also have two personal projects made with Unity:
- Knight, monsters and arena (action 3D PC game)
- Bea's Gift (endless runner 2D mobile game)

##### With "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science" course I learned:
- A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
- Concepts like: abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering and web development
- Familiarity in a number of languages: C, Python, SQL and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML

##### With another student we created a website where I got experience with:
- Front-end: HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Back-end: Java + SpringBoot + Maven
- REST API

##### Enough knowledge about:
- Good programming practices
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID design principles
- GoF programming patterns
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Work experience
At the moment, I have no work experience.

## Future plans
At the moment I'm going to finish college and all my courses from HarvardX: "CS50's Introduction to Game Development" and "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". Then I'll look for a remote or entry-level job as a Junior Unity 3D Developer or Junior Full Stack Web Developer.
